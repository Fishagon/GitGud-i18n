    "Content": "Git is a version control system. That means it helps developers track changes to their files over time. If you've ever lost work, needed to undo something, or wanted to understand who changed what in a team project, version control is the answer.\n\nGit is local-first and distributed — you don't need to be online to use it, and every copy of a Git repository contains the full history. This makes Git reliable, flexible, and powerful, especially for software development.",

    "Title": "What Is a Repository?",
    "Content": "A Git repository — or \"repo\" — is a project directory that's being tracked by Git. What makes a folder a Git repository is a hidden .git/ folder inside it. This .git/ folder contains all your project's history, branches, configuration, and more.\n\nYou can create a new repo with git init or clone an existing one with git clone.

    "Content": "Git's mental model includes three main areas:\n\nWorking Directory - Your actual files on disk.\nStaging Area - A preview of what will be committed.\nRepository - The history of saved commits.\n\nWhen you modify files, they're updated in the working directory. When you git add them, they move into the staging area. When you git commit, they're saved into the repository.",
